frosk-current
=============

The most current version of frosk, quite possibly unstable

Philosophy
----------

The frosk philosophy aims for tranquility and mediation, to be one with the
source and find peace in bytes. Yet frosk, and its philosophy, are human
constructions, and as a result are inherently flawed, yet acceptance and
minimization of these flaws are what admirable goals we adhere too.

Whilst we do not deny the usefulness of optimization, it is not a high priority
for the frosk project, nor is pessimization. In fact, with regard to the
typical question of "Is the glass half full, or half empty?", we answer neither
with the positive nor with the negative, for the glass is neither half full nor
half empty; indeed, if you want a glass, you should implement it first.
