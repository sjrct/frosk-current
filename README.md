The most current version of frosk, quite possibly unstable

Philosophy
----------

The frosk philosophy aims for elegance and philosophy, both in its own design
and in contents as well. Yet it is furthermore a human construct, and a such
subject to the fallibility of human nature, and therefore constructed in a
manner in which it is malleable and not adverse to revision.

Whilst we do not deny the usefulness optimization, it is not a high priority
for the frosk project, nor is pessimization. In fact, with regard to the
typical question of "Is the glass half full, or half empty?", we answer neither
with the positive nor with the negative, for the glass is neither half full nor
half empty; indeed, if you want a glass, you should implement it first.
